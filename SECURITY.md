# Security Policy

Report vulnerabilities via GitHub private vulnerability reporting (Security
tab → "Report a vulnerability"), not via a public issue. Include: description
+ impact, minimal reproducer, affected version (`ug_version()`).

Only the latest released line is supported. The C ABI is frozen as of 1.0.0
(semver applies: breaking changes bump the major version).

## Surface

- C ABI trusts its callers (C pointers, lengths) and never raises; out-of-range
  input is clamped. Foreign callers validate untrusted input before calling.
- Python binding adds the domain check and raises `ValueError`/`TypeError`.
- Single-threaded, reentrant; no global mutable state.
